        "description": "Drowsy driving causes over 100,000 crashes annually and generates $12.5 billion in direct losses globally. Evidence indicates that fatigue is involved in 16–20% of crashes across major markets, with approximately 91,000 fatigue-related crashes and 800 deaths annually in the US alone, and comparable figures in Europe and Asia. Actual figures are likely significantly higher due to chronic under-reporting. Despite this documented impact, 97% of drivers lack access to real-time fatigue monitoring systems. Existing telematics and black-box solutions track driving behaviour; speeding, braking patterns, lane adherence, but do not measure whether drivers remain alert, creating a critical blind spot in loss prevention.",
